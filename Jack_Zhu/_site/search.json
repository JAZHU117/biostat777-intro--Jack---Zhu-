It should be noted that during the fall and winter, the most number of numbat sightings were noted around 1:00-2:00 pm as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Important**: Please note that this graph was constructed after omitting the missing data for time of day (hour) and season.\n\n\n\n\n## Creating a Frequency Table for # of Spottings Across Recorded Years \n\n## Restricting Data Set to Only Observation with Date/Year Data\n\nyear_freq0 &lt;-numbats.3%&gt;%\n  count(year) %&gt;%\n  rename(Year = year, Frequency = n)\n\nnumbats.clean1 &lt;- numbats.3 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(year))\n\nyear_freq &lt;- numbats.clean1 %&gt;%\n  count(year) %&gt;%\n  rename(Year = year, Frequency = n)\n\nggplot(year_freq, aes(x = Year, y = Frequency, group = 1)) +  # n represents the frequency count\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +  # Optionally, add points for each category\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Categories\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1968, 2023))+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting the number of numbat spottings against the year, it seems that there were not many numbat spottings prior to the year 1968. This may be due to the lack of interest or infrastructure for studying the species, or both. There were also 253 missing observations for year. Perhaps with a richer data set, the graph may look very different.\n\n##Generating a Frequency Table for the # of Numbat Spottings at Specific Time of Week (Weekday/Weekend)\n\nweekend_freq0 &lt;- numbats.3 %&gt;%\n  count(timewk) %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Time of Week\" = timewk, Frequency = n)\n\n##Printing Frequency Table \nprint(weekend_freq0)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  `Time of Week` Frequency\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n1 Weekday              414\n2 Weekend              138\n3 &lt;NA&gt;                 253\n\n##There are 253 missing observations \n\nnumbats.clean2 &lt;- numbats.3 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(year))\nweekend_freq1 &lt;- numbats.clean2 %&gt;%\n  count(timewk) %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Time of Week\" = timewk, Frequency = n)\n\n##Printing Frequency Table \nprint(weekend_freq1)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  `Time of Week` Frequency\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n1 Weekday              414\n2 Weekend              138\n\nggplot(weekend_freq1, aes(x = `Time of Week`, y = Frequency, fill = `Time of Week`)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Numbat Spottings by Time of Week\", \n       x = \"Time of Week\", \n       y = \"Frequency\") +\ntheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen generating a bar chart of the frequency of numbat during the weekday or the weekend, it appears that there are more weekday numbat spottings than weekend numbat spottings."

I ran a one-way ANOVA test with the variables representing the hour of the day (hour) and the season of the year (season). There was a statistically significant difference between the mean hour of numbat sightings across seasons (F(3, 548)=4.75, p=0.0028)."

    "text": "Discussion\nBased on the data, numbat sightings tend to occur in the afternoon (around the 13th or 14th hour, or 1:00-2:00 pm, with most spottings occuring around 1:00 pm). Surprisingly, there appear to be more sightings on numbats in the fall and winter rather than the spring or summer, and there tend to be more weekday numbat spottings than weekend nubat spottings. There is a statistically significant association (F(3, 548)=4.75, p=0.0028) between the mean hour of day when numbats are sighted and the season of the year.\nDespite these results, it is worth noting that there are 253 observations with missing data for the year and time of day (hour, day, season). Without more data on who conducted numbat spottings and or how the data of reports were gathered, it is difficult to draw inferences on why numbats were sighted more frequently on weekdays than weekends.\n\nA note to the TA: Here are the functions that I used from each of the following packages: dplyr and ggplot2\ndplyr: arrange(), filter(), mutate(), select(), if_else()\nggplot2: geom_col (), geon_histogram, geom_line(), geom_point()\nOther packages used: kableExtra"
